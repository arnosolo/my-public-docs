Basically, this video taught you how to create a simple snake game. Through this video I found drawing on a canvas was fun, so I reproduced some works according to some other similar videos, and created something similar like this one: <a href="https://arnosolo.github.io/oversimplified_gravity_simulator/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Oversimplified Gravity Simulator</a>. Basically, some small balls are drawn on a canvas, and they are attracted by each other. During the time of writing this project, some buttons for adjusting parameters need to be drawn, and I found my way of drawing the GUI clumsy. So I started learning frontend frameworks like vue, react. This helped me landing my first frontend job.</li><li>Another interest of mine was embedded software like <a href="https://arnosolo.github.io/simple-3d-printer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">building firmware of a 3D printer</a>.
